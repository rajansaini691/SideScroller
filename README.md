# SideScroller
Welcome! This repository contains the source code to my final game in AP Comp Sci A. It is a unique twist on the sidescroller genre, where the players are their own enemy, having to both collaborate and sabotage to stay alive. 
The architecture was inspired by console games, in which there is one main "server" and four input peripherals. Similarly, the server is like the console, and the clients function as controllers. 
If you want to play the game, download the server and client jar files. The server file runs on one machine, whose monitor should be visible by all players. Then each player should download the client file on their respective machine and run it.
